# SmartClass-A.I.ssistant

### Objectives

The primary objective of the SmartClass A.I.ssistant project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to analyze and classify student images into four distinct states: Neutral, Engaged/Focused, Angry/Irritated, and Happy , the fourth state we have chosen. This involves collecting, cleaning, and labeling suitable datasets, building and training the CNN model, evaluating its performance using various metrics, and conducting bias analysis to ensure ethical AI application. The project aims to provide real-time feedback during lectures by recognizing students' facial expressions, enhancing the learning experience dynamically.

### Group Information



  * <strong> Kaloyan Kirilov (github.com/kalo2711) </strong>: Data Specialist <br> As the Data Specialist, my primary responsibility is managing the dataset lifecycle, which includes sourcing, pre-processing, and loading data. I will ensure data quality and integrity, while also collaborating with the team to enhance our understanding and troubleshooting of data-related issues.
  * <strong> Mamadou Kaba (github.com/mdkaba) </strong>: Training Specialist <br> As the Training Specialist, I will be the main person crafting, tuning, and training the Convolutional Neural Network. While I will be involved in all stages of model development, my primary focus will be on setting hyperparameters, monitoring training progress, and troubleshooting convergence issues.
  * <strong> Jaskirat Kaur (github.com/jaskiratkaur1906) </strong>: Evaluation Specialist <br> As the Evaluation Specialist, my main task will be to rigorously test and evaluate our model's performance. I will analyze predictions, identify strengths and weaknesses, and detect any biases. My work will guide the refinement of the model and ensure it performs accurately and fairly across all metrics.
